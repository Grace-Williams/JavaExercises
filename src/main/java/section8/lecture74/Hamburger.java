// The purpose of the application is to help a fictitious company called Bill Burgers
// to manage their process of selling hamburgers
// Our application will help Bill to select types of burgers, some of the additional items (additions)
// to be added to the burgers and pricing
// We want to create a base hamburger, but also 2 other types of hamburgers that are popular ones in Bills store
// The basic hamburger should have the following items
// Bread roll type, meat and up to 4 additional additions (things like lettuce, tomato, carrot, etc) that the
// customer can select to be added to the burger
// Each one of these items gets charged an additional price so you need some way
// to track how many items got added and to calculate the final price (base burger with all the additions)
// This burger has a base price and the additions are all separately priced (up to 4 additions, see above)

// Create a Hamburger class to deal with all the above.
// The constructor should only include the roll type, meat and price, can also include name of burger or you can use a setter
// Also create 2 extra varieties of Hamburgers (subclasses) to cater for
// a. Healthy burger - (on a brown rye bread roll), plus 2 addition items that can be added.
// The healthy burger can have 6 items (Additions) in total.  HINT: You probably want to process
// the 2 additional items in this class (subclass of Hamburger), not the base class (Hamburger) since
// the 2 additions are only appropriate for this new class (in other words new burger type)
// b. Deluxe hamburger - comes with chips and drinks as additions but no extra additions are allowed
// HINT: You have to find a way to automatically add these new additions at the time the deluxe burger object
// is created and the prevent other additions being made

// All 3 classes should have a method that can be called anytime to show the base price of the hamburger plus all additions,
// each showing the addition name, and addition price, and a grand/final total for the burger (base price + all additions)
// For the 2 additional classes this may require you to be looking at the base class for pricing and then adding totals to final price
