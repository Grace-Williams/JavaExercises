// Create a single room of a house using composition
// Think about the things that should be included in the room
// Maybe physical parts of the house but furniture as well
// Add at least one method to access an object via a getter and
// then that objects public method as you saw in the previous video
// then add at least one method to hide the object e.g. not using a getter
// but to access the object used in composition within the main class like you saw in the video
