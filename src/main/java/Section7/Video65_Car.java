// Inheritance challenge
// Start with  a base class of a Vehicle, then create a Car class that inherits from this base class
// Finally, create another class, a specific type of Car that inherits from the Car class
// You should be able to hand steering, changing gears, and moving (speed)
// You will want to decide where to put the appropriate state and behaviours (fields and methods)
// As mentioned above, changing gears, increasing/decreasing speed should be included
// For your specific type of vehicle, you will want to add something for that type of car
