# Goal

The shopping basket contains an order for apples (25p), bananas (18p) , oranges (35p), carrots (65p per kilo),
courgettes (20p) and peppers (55p).

Current deals are 3 for 2 on peppers.   30% off apples when you buy more than 3 apples, 50% off apples when you buy
more than 7 apples.  Get a free courgette if you buy more than 5 fruit.   Get a free kilo of carrots for every 4
items of fruit bought.

Implement the method Checkout.calculatePrice() to return the correct price of the basket.

# What we like

* Clean, semantic readable code - stay consistent with existing style of the code and imagine someone else or a
  future-you wanting to make further changes.
* [SOLID, KISS & DRY](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/73065/what-are-dry-kiss-solid-etc-classified-as)
* Tests that assert and document desired behaviour
* Self contained documentation - others should be able to pick up the project and know what to do with it.
* Informative commit history
